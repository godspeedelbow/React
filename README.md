## Handing in homework
Take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) made by Daan, he explains how your homework needs to be handed in.

Also review the Git [workflow material](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/Git/blob/master/Lecture-3.md) from the JavaScript3 module, use this as a reference.

## Some background information about React and JS

Watch this video from Facebook about why they started React:

https://youtu.be/nYkdrAPrdcw

Also be sure you're familiar with ES6-syntax. See this video about ES6 (the video is in Node, but the syntax for React is the same):

https://www.lynda.com/Node-js-tutorials/Switching-ES6-Node-js/546100-2.html

This is a handy reference of all features of ES6:

http://es6-features.org

Please *do not worry about understanding all*. However, do make sure you understand the following, as we'll be using them a lot:

- http://es6-features.org/#Constants
- http://es6-features.org/#ObjectMatchingShorthandNotation
- http://es6-features.org/#RestParameter
- http://es6-features.org/#SpreadOperator

## Learning examples

### Counter [[source](/examples/counter)]

Demonstrates:

1. Most basic implementation of component state
2. Handler functions bound to `onClick`

### Clocks [[source](/examples/clocks)]

Follows the React docs clock example [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html). Uses [momentjs](https://github.com/moment/moment) and [moment-timezone](https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone) for datetime functionality.

Demonstrates:

1. Using both state and props in a component tree
2. Passing event handlers as props
3. Rendering components in a loop
4. Conditional JSX rendering (header count)
5. State-bound lifecycle and lifecycle events (clock interval)
