# Homework Week 3
Reuse the app from week 2 for this week. Don't forget to git commit and git push your changes from week 2 before you start changing it for week 3.

## Outline
Build an application thats loads and displays stories from Hacker News. The user should be able to decide which stories he/she wants to see.

You know from this weeks lesson how to update the state of a component using setState. This is what you will use to enable the user to decide which stories should be displayed.

## Instructions

- make a navigation bar for different types of HN stories: `top`, `new`, `show`, `ask`, `job`
  - add these items to the navbar (add a navbar if you don't have one yet, we have done it as a part of the week3 lecture)
  - when you click on one of the items, it should load the respective stories below. For example if you click on `job` the job stories should appear. Use the HN data from the week2 exercise.
  - when you click another, the original stories should disappear and the new ones should be shown. Once again using the HN data from week2.

- fetch stories from Hacker News
  - use the following library code [getHNStories](W3-get-hn-stories.js) to fetch stories from HN
  - you need to install two packages. Make sure you execute this command in the root of your project (not in `/src` or anything else):
    ```
    npm install graphqlhub-schemas graphql --save
    ```
  - try to not worry about how exactly it is implemented but instead look at/run the example and try to figure out how it works:
    ```js
    /**
    * fetches HackerNews stories.
    * example:
    *   getHNStories('job')
    *    .then(console.log)
    *     .catch(console.error);
    **/
    ```
 - Change your app so that instead of using the static HN data from week2, it loads the relevant data from HN based on what the user chooses.

- BONUS:
show a "Loading ..." text when the data is loading
- To improve the user experience, show the user that the data is on the way by displaying a "Loading ..." text while the data is loading.

- BONUS 2: if there's an error from the API, show the error
- if there's an error show it on the page. You can test it by using the Chrome Developer Tools. Go to the Performance Tab and set Network to offline
