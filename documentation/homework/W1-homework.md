When you are done issue a PR with your homework as explained in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o0yomUVVpU&index=2&list=PLVYDhqbgYpYUGxRdtQdYVE5Q8h3bt6SIA) made by Daan.

## Outline

- Make a page that describes yourself. Some suggestions:
  - Where are you from, where did you grow up?
  - What topic do you like most in programming?
  - What is your favorite celebration/holiday in Sweden?
  - What do you want to be when you grow up? :)
- Add a picture of yourself
- Try to lay it out with some css

## Instructions

React is all about composition of components - the challenge is to do that here as well, even though it is a very simple page.
- make a sketch of the page you want to make, try to visualize the whole thing, but don't include many details. It can be a very rough sketch.
- identify which pieces of the about page are functionally/stylistically different, make a list (e.g. `Menu`, `Footer`, `Image`, etc.)
- start with the outer most component, `App` and determine which components are its immediate children
- write those components, include and compose them in `App` and repeat the process, going down the component hierarchy
- you'll discover that some components are repeated (e.g. `Paragraph`). DRY but define those components once and re-use them
- you can start out with no styling at all and do it at then end, or you can style your components immediately â€“ it's up to you

## Scoring

You will be scored on:

- Composition
- Code organisation
- Cleanliness of code
