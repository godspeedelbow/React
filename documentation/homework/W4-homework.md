# Homework Week 4

week 4 homework:
- finish the Tic Tac Toe game we started during this lesson
- the code we have created together is here: <Add link>

## Outline

Go to [tictactoe.com](http://tictactoe.com) and play the two player game. The goal is to re-create the game in React ourselves.

Remember what we discussed before we started coding, when we analysed the game:
- A Tic Tac Toe game consists of a `Board`, `Cells`, `Pieces`
- There are two players with each their own piece (`x` or `o`).
- Players take turns placing pieces on the board
- A player can only place a piece in an empty cell
- When a player has three of her own pieces in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, that player has won.

## Instructions

TBD

## Scoring

You will be scored on:

- Completion
- Code organisation
- Cleanliness of code
- BONUS
